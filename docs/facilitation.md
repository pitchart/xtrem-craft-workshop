## What's the problem ?
We have  to build a spreadsheet to manage money in more than one currency : perhaps to manage a stock portfolio ?

| Stock | Stock exchange | Shares | Share Price | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| IBM | NASDAQ | 100 | 124 USD | 12400 USD |
| BMW | DAX | 400 | 75 EUR | 30000 EUR |
| Samsung | KSE | 300 | 68000 KRW | 20400000 KRW |

To build it, we'd need to do simple arithmetic operations on numbers :

```text
5 USD x 2 = 10 USD
4002 KRW / 4 = 1000.5 KRW

// convert
5 USD + 10 EUR = 17 USD
1 USD + 1100 KRW = 2200 KRW
```

* We can use this table to determine exchange rates :

| From | To   | Rate    |
|------|------|---------|
| EUR  | USD  | 1.2     |
| USD  | EUR  | 0.82    |
| USD  | KRW  | 1100    |
| KRW  | EUR  | 0.0009  |
| EUR  | KRW  | 1344    |
| KRW  | EUR  | 0.00073 |

## List of Features to implement
We have already started the implementation by using TDD. We have discovered examples that helped us drive our implementation.

```text
Money Calculator :
✅ 10 EUR x 2 = 20 EUR
✅ 4002 KRW / 4 = 1000.5 KRW
✅ 5 USD + 10 USD = 15 USD

Bank implementation :
✅ Determine exchange rate based on the currencies involved (from -> to)
✅ Improve the implementation of exchange rates
✅ Allow exchange rates to be modified
```
